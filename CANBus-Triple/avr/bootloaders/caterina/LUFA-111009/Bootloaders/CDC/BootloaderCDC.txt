 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  This bootloader enumerates to the host as a CDC Class device (virtual serial port), allowing for AVR109
 *  protocol compatible programming software to load firmware onto the AVR.
 *
 *  Out of the box this bootloader builds for the USB1287, and will fit into 4KB of bootloader space. If
 *  you wish to enlarge this space and/or change the AVR model, you will need to edit the BOOT_START and MCU
 *  values in the accompanying makefile.
 *
 *  When the bootloader is running, the board's LED(s) will flash at regular intervals to distinguish the
 *  bootloader from the normal user application.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Installation Driver Installation
 *
 *  After running this bootloader for the first time on a new computer, you will need to supply the .INF
 *  file located in this bootloader project's directory as the device's driver when running under Windows.
 *  This will enable Windows to use its inbuilt CDC drivers, negating the need for custom drivers for the
 *  device. Other Operating Systems should automatically use their own inbuilt CDC-ACM drivers.
 *
 *  \section Sec_HostApp Host Controller Application
 *
 *  This bootloader is compatible with the open source application AVRDUDE, Atmel's AVRPROG, or other
 *  applications implementing the AVR109 protocol, which is documented on the Atmel website as an application
 *  note.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_AVRDude AVRDUDE (Windows, Mac, Linux)
 *
 *  AVRDude is a free, cross-platform and open source command line programmer for Atmel and third party AVR
 *  programmers. It is available on the the Windows platform as part of the "WinAVR" package, or on other systems
 *  either from a build from the official source code, or in many distributions as a precompiled binary package.
 *
 *  To load a new HEX file with AVRDude, specify "AVR109" as the programmer, with the allocated COM port. On Windows
 *  platforms this will be a COMx port name:
 *  \code
 *  avrdude -c AVR109 -p at90usb1287 -P COM0 -U flash:w:Mouse.hex
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  On Linux systems, this will typically be a /dev/ttyACMx port name:
 *  \code
 *  avrdude -c AVR109 -p at90usb1287 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -U flash:w:Mouse.hex
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  Refer to the AVRDude project documentation for additional usage instructions.
 *

 *    <td>NO_BLOCK_SUPPORT</td>
 *    <td>Makefile LUFA_OPTS</td>
 *    <td>Define to disable memory block read/write support in the bootloader, requiring all reads and writes to be made
 *        using the byte-level commands.</td>

 *    <td>NO_EEPROM_BYTE_SUPPORT</td>
 *    <td>Makefile LUFA_OPTS</td>

 *    <td>Makefile LUFA_OPTS</td>

 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>NO_LOCK_BYTE_WRITE_SUPPORT</td>
 *    <td>Makefile LUFA_OPTS</td>
 *    <td>Define to disable lock byte write support in the bootloader, preventing the lock bits from being set programmatically.</td>
 *   </tr>
