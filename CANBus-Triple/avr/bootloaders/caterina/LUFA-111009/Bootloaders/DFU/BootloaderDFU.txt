 *
 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  This bootloader enumerates to the host as a DFU Class device, allowing for DFU-compatible programming
 *  software to load firmware onto the AVR.
 *
 *  Out of the box this bootloader builds for the USB1287, and should fit into 4KB of bootloader space. If
 *  you wish to enlarge this space and/or change the AVR model, you will need to edit the BOOT_START and MCU
 *  values in the accompanying makefile.
 *
 *  When the bootloader is running, the board's LED(s) will flash at regular intervals to distinguish the
 *  bootloader from the normal user application.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Installation Driver Installation
 *
 *  This bootloader is designed to be compatible with Atmel's provided Windows DFU class drivers. You will need to
 *  install Atmel's DFU drivers prior to using this bootloader on Windows platforms. If you are using a 64 bit Windows
 *  OS, you will need to either disable the driver signing requirement (see online tutorials for details) or use a
 *  digitally signed version of the official Atmel driver provided by a third party AVR user at
 *  <a>http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?module=Freaks%20Academy&func=viewItem&item_id=2196&item_type=project</a>.
 *
 *  \note This device spoofs Atmel's DFU Bootloader USB VID and PID so that the Atmel DFU bootloader
 *        drivers included with FLIP will work. If you do not wish to use Atmel's ID codes, please
 *        manually change them in Descriptors.c and alter your driver's INF file accordingly.
 *
 *  \section Sec_HostApp Host Controller Application
 *  
 *  This bootloader is compatible with Atmel's FLIP utility on Windows machines, and dfu-programmer on Linux machines.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_FLIP FLIP (Windows)
 *
 *  FLIP (Flexible In-System Programmer) is a utility written by Atmel, and distributed for free on the Atmel website.
 *  The FLIP utility is designed to assist in the bootloader programming of a range of Atmel devices, through several
 *  popular physical interfaces including USB. It is written in Java, however makes use of native extensions for USB
 *  support and thus is only offered on Windows.
 *
 *  To program a device using FLIP, refer to the Atmel FLIP documentation.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_DFUProgrammer dfu-programmer (Linux)
 *
 *  dfu-programmer is an open-source command line solution for the bootloader programming of Atmel devices through a
 *  USB connection, using the DFU protocol, available for download at <a>http://sourceforge.net/projects/dfu-programmer/</a>.
 *
 *  The following example loads a HEX file into the AVR's FLASH memory using dfu-programmer:
 *  \code
 *  dfu-programmer at90usb1287 erase flash Mouse.hex
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>Define Name:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Location:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Description:</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>SECURE_MODE</td>
 *    <td>BootloaderDFU.h</td>
 *    <td>If defined to true, the bootloader will not accept any memory commands other than a chip erase on start-up, until an
 *        erase has been performed. This can be used in conjunction with the AVR's lockbits to prevent the AVRs firmware from
 *        being dumped by unauthorized persons.</td>
